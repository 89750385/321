# sd-webui-comfyui
## Overview
sd-webui-comfyui is an extension for [Automatic1111's stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that embeds [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) in its own tab. This allows to create ComfyUI nodes that interact directly with some parts of the webui's normal pipeline.
